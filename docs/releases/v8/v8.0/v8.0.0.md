<!-- alex-c-line-end-release-summary -->

## Description of Changes

- Refactors this repository to use the newest release note directory pattern from alex-c-line.
- Changes the actions so that they are compatible with said newest directory pattern.

## Migration Notes

- Instead of storing release notes in `docs/releases/<major|minor|patch>/vX.Y.Z.md`, we instead store them in `docs/releases/vX/vX.Y/vX.Y.Z.md`.
- See [alex-c-line release note v1.20.0](https://github.com/alextheman231/alex-c-line/releases/tag/v1.20.0) for more information.

## Additional Notes

- If I had a penny for every time I ended up shipping a new major version of this repository, I would probably be very rich by now...
- Yeah, sorry for the constant major updates, everyone! Can't promise it won't happen again, though.
