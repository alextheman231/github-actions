## Description of Changes

- Ugh, really?!
- I was referencing `steps.check_version.outputs.release_doc_path`, except it's really meant to be `steps.get_version.outputs.release_doc_path`, and GitHub Actions did nothing to let me know beforehand?! No weird yellow underline or warning or anything?!

## Additional Notes

- Well, at least the document for this is grouped together with the main v8 release, so this isn't completely separate from the initial release note in the repository, but still!
- The fact that the v8 release created with an empty body, though... That is so annoying! v8 is officially ruined.
- Still, though, guess I've gotta PATCH IT UUUUUUUP!
