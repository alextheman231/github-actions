<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-summary -->
This is a new minor release of the `github-actions` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way and should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read the description of changes below.

## Description of Changes

- Add a reusable workflow to restrict `alex-up-bot/` branches from being created
    - If they do get created, the pull request will be closed and the branch deleted.
    - This is being done to ensure that no-one can end up messing with the automated pull requests by creating a branch that only our automated pull request bot can create.

## Additional Notes

- So... I can't declare the conditions for which my reusable workflow will be allowed to run in... why?
- That is, you can't say at the conditions level that I have a reusable workflow that should only run on actions that trigger on pull request to main, for example.
- That feels like such core logic to the reusable workflows that I am honestly shocked it's not already being done!
- Then again, GitHub Actions feels like it cuts a lot of corners throughout, so I'm also not surprised...
