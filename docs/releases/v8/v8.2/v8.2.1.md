## Description of Changes

- Fix the `restrict-alex-up-bot-branches` workflow so that commits to an alex-up-bot branch that was initially opened by alex-up-bot are allowed.
    - This is needed for the `update-dependencies` workflow where I may need to make manual edits to the auto-updates if it fails CI.
- Rename the step that gets the alex-up-bot token in most workflows.
    - Purely cosmetic change because I feel like it.
