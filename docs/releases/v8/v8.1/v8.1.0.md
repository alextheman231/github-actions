<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-summary -->
This is a new minor release of the `github-actions` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way and should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read the description of changes below.

## Description of Changes

- Rename `pnpm-ci` to `package-ci`
    - This better reflects what this set of CI checks actually does.
- Add a check for the version change that runs on `alex-up-bot/change-*-version` branches.
    - This speeds up CI times on the version change pull requests so that instead of running the full main test suite, it instead runs a smaller series of steps purely dedicated to the release/version change.

## Additional Notes

- Note that there is a known flaw as of now, where I can't restrict users from creating a branch named `alex-up-bot/change-major-version`, for example, because this organisation is not an enterprise organisation.
- As such, our closest bet for now is to create an action that always fails if the user who created an `alex-up-bot/` branch is not the `alex-up-bot` itself.
- I will add the above point in a future release.
