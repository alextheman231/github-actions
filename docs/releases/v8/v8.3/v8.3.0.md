This is a new minor release of the `github-actions` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way and should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read the description of changes below.

## Description of Changes

- Add steps to `commit-version-change` to also generate the feature documentation.
    - This will especially be useful for utility to avoid that weird thing where we have a version change pull request and a feature docs pull request up at the same time.
    - I feel like changes in version should always prompt changes in documentation for the following reasons:
        1. The docs site does show the version number.
        2. The release is really when the feature makes it in for the first time, and so automatically keeping the docs up-to-date helps them reflect reality better.
