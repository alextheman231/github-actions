## Description of Changes

- Adds `run-build` as an input to `commit-version-change`, not just `_commit-version-change`

## Additional Notes

- Ah, the irony. Reusable workflows exist as a way to reduce duplication across repositories, but here we need to duplicate the input because of the reusable workflow thing behaving weirdly...
- I really hate GitHub Actions so much...
