# v7.2.2 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `github-actions` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Add back the install dependencies step to `create-pull-request-template`
    - Still needed, otherwise I think the `alex-c-line.config.js` can't be imported from the actions.
