# v4.0.6 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `github-actions` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Add a step to `update-dependencies` that checks for existence of Terraform files, and if found, set up Terraform before updating.
    - This is needed in the Infrastructure repository to ensure that the action also targets Terraform providers as well.
    - This should not affect other repositories, though, as they don't use Terraform and Terraform updates are skipped in non-Terraform repositories.
