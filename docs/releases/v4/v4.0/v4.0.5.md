# v4.0.5 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `github-actions` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds an output to `npm-registry-publish` to determine if the package published successfully or not.
    - This will be helpful in the NPM package repositories to ensure that a GitHub release does not get created if the publish to NPM did not happen.
