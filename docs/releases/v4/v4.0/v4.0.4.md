# v4.0.4 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `github-actions` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Ensure release creation can only happen if the release document is present

## Additional Notes

- This follows from an oversight found in components where it created a release despite the document not existing. This changes it so that it cannot create a release if a document does not exist.
