# v4.1.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new minor release of the `github-actions` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Rename `actions-ci` to `self-ci`.
    - This is what this repository uses to check itself.
- Adds a new reusable `actions-ci` workflow for other repositories to use.
    - This will be used to allow other repositories to lint the actions without needing to worry about whether the user has Zizmor locally installed or not.

## Additional Notes

- Note that I will need to change Infrastructure to set `self-ci` to be the new required CI check, rather than `actions-ci` now.
