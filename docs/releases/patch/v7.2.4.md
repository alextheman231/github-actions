# v7.2.4 (Patch Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new patch release of the `github-actions` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Fix the input name in `create-pull-request-templates`.
    - It should be `inputs.skip-build`, not `inputs.skip_build`

## Additional Notes

- Don't do what I do. Don't try and edit actions from your phone. It never goes down well.
- I totally blame the lack of editor hints in GitHub mobile for making me have to create this release note.
