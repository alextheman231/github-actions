# v7.2.1 (Patch Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new patch release of the `github-actions` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Get rid of build and install steps in `create-pull-request-templates`
    - We only really need to install alex-c-line - project dependencies/build step is irrelevant here.
