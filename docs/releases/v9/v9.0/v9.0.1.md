## Description of Changes

- Refactor package-ci to allow it to be skipped despite the matrix.
    - Just another classic case of GitHub Actions stepping into leaky implementation zone!
    - We need to do this because the action name expands depending on the matrix job and we can't just say "require any job starting with 'source-code-ci'" because that would be too easy!
