## Description of Changes

- Refactor `package-ci` so that it considers skipped to be valid as well.
    - Only explicit failure or cancellation is considered failure now.

## Additional Notes

- Funny how v9 was supposed to reduce the amount of patch versions needed to fix workflows, yet here we are two patches in already...
- In fairness, this is just because the workflow I'm patching here doesn't get used in this repository itself, hence it must be tested in the actual repository I am using it in, and that requires patch releases.
- I guess constant patch releases like this is inevitable for this package... Unfortunately...
