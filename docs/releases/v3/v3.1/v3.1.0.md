# v3.1.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new minor release of the `github-actions` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds the `create-feature-docs` workflow found in `@alextheman/utility`
    - I am currently working on the feature docs for ESLint plugin, which will most likely need access to this workflow as well. I still have yet to decide on the actual implementation of this, but I think the public utilities there will at least use TypeDoc.
    - TypeDoc is already installed in ESLint plugin as it is the one distributing the config for that, so it would make sense to actually use it there as well for something.
