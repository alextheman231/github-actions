# v3.0.3 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `github-actions` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- This just gets rid of `git fetch --unshallow origin main` in most workflows, as it is no longer necessary.
- The motivation for including this is no longer present in the new versioning/docs pattern I have recently stabilised, so I think it should be safe to remove.
