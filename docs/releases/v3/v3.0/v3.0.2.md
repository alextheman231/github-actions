## Description of Changes

- Removed the step to use PNPM in commit-version-change
    - I was never really using PNPM in this workflow, and I think it was that step that was creating weird flaky behaviour with Use Node.js because of the caching. Given that there's no real benefit of using PNPM in that workflow, I've removed the step to set it up there entirely.
