# v3.0.5 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `github-actions` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Add AlexUpBot as the committer to the actions that create a pull request
    - Without this, it'd show AlexUpBot as author, but still the generic GitHub bot as the committer. This ensures that AlexUpBot is also the committer.
