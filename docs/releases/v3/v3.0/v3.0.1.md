# v3.0.1 (Patch Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `github-actions` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Changes the pull request author to be the bot user.
    - I think the pull request composite action I'm currently using defaults to me generally, even though I do have a step to set up the GitHub bot user.
    - As such, I need to set the commit author in the pull request action inputs directly so that AlexUpBot's information is what get used rather than my own GitHub details.
