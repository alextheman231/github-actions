# v5.0.0 (Major Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new major release of the `github-actions` package. It has the potential to introduce breaking changes that may require a large amount of refactoring. Please read the below description of changes and migration notes for more information.

## Description of Changes

- Move the repository to my new `alextheman231` organisation.
    - This will make managing this repository and others a lot easier as they can all live in one collection, and we can also benefit from other organisation-level benefits such as merge queues.
- Update the self-references in this repository to point to the organisation copy of this repository.
    - I still hate this very much, but read release note `v4.0.3` for the full rant.

## Migration Notes

- Wherever you are referencing a composite action or reusable workflow starting with `AlexMan123456/github-actions`, replace this with `alextheman231/github-actions`.

## Additional Notes

- I think this should be the only one of these that requires a release and a version change as it will break usage other repositories due to the need to change the path. Other repositories should be fine as is, only really needing a patch (or minor at worst) maybe just to test the trusted publishing still works.
