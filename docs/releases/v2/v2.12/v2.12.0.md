# v2.12.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new minor release of the `AlexMan123456/github-actions` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- The `commit-version-change` action now uses the release docs to determine what the pull request body should be.
    - Note that it will now also error if a release note was not found for the version we are trying to release.
    - Release notes should be located in `docs/releases/(major|minor|patch)/vX.Y.Z.md`, with the file name matching what the version would be after running this action.

## Additional Notes

- You may need to refactor your directory such that you have these release docs.
- Eventually, I will add a command to AlexCLine that automatically generates these release notes. In the meantime, they must be created manually.
- Examples can be copied from `@alextheman/utility` or `@alextheman/eslint-plugin`, or even this document!
