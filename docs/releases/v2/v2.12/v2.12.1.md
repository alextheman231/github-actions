# v2.12.1 (Patch release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new patch release of the `AlexMan123456/github-actions` package. It fixes issues with the package in a way that should require no refactoring. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Get rid of a redundant step in the `commit-version-change` workflow.
    - The `Determine if a release note exists` is not required as the `Create pull request` step already errors if the release note does not exist.
