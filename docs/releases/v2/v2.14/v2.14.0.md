# v2.14.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new minor release of the `github-actions` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds a step in `commit-version-change` to automatically change the status to Released
- This gets rid of the need to do this in a separate pull request, and just gets rid of the need to ever need to manually change the status at all.
- This helps to prevent the release document from getting out-of-sync with reality, where an published version may still have a status of `In progress`, or an unpublished version may have a status of `Released`.
