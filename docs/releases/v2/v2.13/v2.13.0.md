# v2.13.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: Released

This is a new minor release of the `AlexMan123456/github-actions` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- The `update-dependencies` action now points to the `tooling_change.md` file in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` as updating dependencies is a tooling change and should be marked as such.

## Additional Notes

- You may need to refactor your directory such that you have this document.
- Example can be copied from the template in this repository.
