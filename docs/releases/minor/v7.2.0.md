# v7.2.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new minor release of the `github-actions` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Adds a new `create-pull-request-templates` workflow, which replaces the template generation in `update-dependencies`
    - After thinking about it a little more, I think the template generation (and potentially docs changes in general) may want to be their own workflow so that documentation changes are kept separate from tooling changes.
    - This also makes the `update-dependencies` workflow a little nicer as well, so that we don't have to do that template selection thing we had been doing, because now `update-dependencies` will always contain tooling changes, whereas `create-pull-request-templates` will always contain documentation changes.

## Additional Notes

- The `create-pull-request-templates` workflow in my repositories will run at 9pm on Sundays as of now. `update-dependencies`, on the other hand, will continue to run at 9pm on Fridays.
