# v7.1.0 (Minor Release)

**Status**: In progress

This is a new minor release of the `github-actions` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way that should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read below the description of changes.

## Description of Changes

- Use the new `create-pull-request-template` command from `alex-c-line`

## Additional Notes

- Note that this will mean that we will have to refactor all repositories to use `alex-c-line.config.js` after this is done, as this new variant of the command uses the config.
- We technically don't **have** to with the command in general if we use flags, but for its use case in the workflow, the command will read the config per repository rather than provide flags, and so it is needed for compatibility with this workflow.
- See [alex-c-line v1.18.0](https://github.com/alextheman231/alex-c-line/releases/tag/v1.18.0) for more information.
